# Lambda Calculus implemented with Go and Typescript

This project contains some Lambda Calculus computations implemented both in Go and in Typescript.

- Natural Numbers as per Chrch encoding with some arithmetics: Sum, Mult, Pow, Sub
- Boolean as per Chrch encoding and boolean logic operators: And, Or, Not
- Recursion via Z-fixed-point combinator through which Factorial calculation is implemented

## Go

### Test

- Go to the Go folder with `cd go`
- Launch the tests with the command `go test ./...`

### Interactive testing and debugging from within VSCode

- Open the test file with VSCode
- Open the "Run" view, i.e. the VSCode view which allows to run programs
- From the top lesft drop-down list, select "GO Launch"
- If required, breakpoints can be placed in the open file in which case the execution stops at the breakpoints and allows interactive
  debugging

## Typescript

### Test

- Go to the Go folder with `cd typescript`
- Launch the tests with the command `npm test`

### Interactive testing and debugging from within VSCode

- Open the test file with VSCode
- Open the "Run" view, i.e. the VSCode view which allows to run programs
- From the top lesft drop-down list, select "Current TS Test File"
- If required, breakpoints can be placed in the open file in which case the execution stops at the breakpoints and allows interactive
  debugging
